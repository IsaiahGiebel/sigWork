In this repository are three other repositories that include significant projects that I have worked on during my time at St.Thomas.

The repository "webdev-rest-main" holds the code for the St.Paul Crime website I created in my web development course.
This website allows users to navigate a map and see how many crimes have been committed in certain neighborhoods in St.Paul.
They may also see details about crimes in a table and they can apply filters to the table to see crimes of specific type, date, and place. 
This website can help advance the common good by allowing residents of St.Paul to understand areas they should avoid to keep themselves and their belongings safe.
It also forces the user to acknowledge the presence of crime around their area and to be more cautious.
Through projects like this we computer scientists can learn how to use our skills to create a better society.

The repository "webdev-dynamic-main" has the code for my Candy Data website. For this project I picked a database that would be used for the purpose of learning how to display information to a user in an easy to read format as well as include a graphic that provided further statistical information. The database I picked holds various information about different candies. This project required me to learn and write a good amount of javascript and jQuery. Most of the code is written in a server.mjs file so most of the content is dynamically populated. I enjoyed this project because it was nice learning how to get data from a database and manipulate it as well as using the data to make a bar chart.

The repository "games" is a personal project that I started this semester. I wanted to create a video game website with a few different games and a login option so that users can keep track of their score. At this moment I am close to finishing the first game (2048). It has been a more challenging and time consuming process than I initially anticipated due to the many details and large amounts of code required to write a seemingly simple game. But through this process I have strengthened my understanding of the core concepts of javascript and have also learned how to use the Phaser framework. I will continue to work on this project in the future and there will be much more learning to come.
