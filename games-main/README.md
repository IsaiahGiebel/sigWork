I began this project with the intention of creating a video game website where users can login and keep track of their scores. 
So far I have mostly finished creating the game 2048.
I wanted to do this personal project to strengthen my javascript skills and also learn a new framework (Phaser). 
I am also interested in how video games are created. 
To run this project you can clone the repository and then you will have to install apache or some other simailar server.
You can download and run the server on Wamp.net. You will need to configure your site on Wamp.net as well. You can then
run your server (such as apache) and then go to the domain you set the site to be at.
